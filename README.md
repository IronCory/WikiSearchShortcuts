# WikiSearchShortcut(s)
Currently only adds the ability to assign a hotkey to the wiki search interface. I made this because I think the search function is convenient, but I don't like reaching all the way to the icon. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I considered adding chat commands such as ::wikisearch ::wikis !wikisearch !wikis to open the interface, but figured this would be easier and more convenient. This is my first plugin and my first time coding something I intend to actually use so any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated. :)
